    content: |-
      I’m a Technical Lead and Senior CS student who loves building scalable architecture from the ground up. I focus on systems that handle complexity, whether that's processing 250k+ daily crypto records or automating onboarding for a 30-person engineering cohort.
      
      Currently, I lead infrastructure at Tekly Studio, managing the GCP and Python ETL pipelines behind our quantitative research. I believe in a fail-fast approach and that good architecture is what separates a script from a system. I operate on Agile principles and am currently diving deeper into DevSecOps.
